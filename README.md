My design studio of AI/ML/CS concepts.

Separated into two sections:
- Algorithms + Data Structures
- AI/ML

## Key Tenets
- Must work functionally
    - Unit tested, applicable
- Must be easy to read
    - Type-checkable, linted, and formatted code
    - Educational, designed for a CS students
    - Sacrifice efficiency and concision for readability

# Design Decisions
Three packages are exposed to the user - algorithms, ml, and structures.
Imports are done quickly and painlessly. We avoid circular imports by importing algorithms needed to create data structures inline.

## Dataclasses
Dataclasses are one of the trickiest things to work with in Python. I tentatively have decided to make any class that would benefit from one of the below points into a dataclass.
Benefits:
- `__init__`, in constructors that simply set all parameters.
- `__eq__`, which ensures that a tuple of object fields are compared.
- `__repr__`, which is perfect for error messages.
- `@dataclass(order=True)` when nodes or structs should be comparable. If a dataclass is not ideal, using `@functools.total_ordering` is a viable alternative.

My choices:
- Explicitly define the `__init__` function whenever you have more initialization logic than "set all parameters as fields". A common example is when a self member variable shouldn't be a constructor parameter. This makes reading the class much easier and allows better control over the logic.
- Create a separate `__str__` function to use when printing the object for visualizing the state of the data structure. `__repr__` should contain a single line while string should be pretty printed.
- Define `__hash__` myself, since I can choose the necessary fields to make a unique hash. Additionally, using `@dataclass(frozen=True)` is almost never a good idea, since you won't be able to even set attributes in `__post_init__`, and the docs specifically point out a performance penalty.
- Prefer the `@with_slots` and the _dataslots_ library over using `__slots__`. It is a clean single decorator and dependency rather than an ugly list of strings.

# Style Guide
- Use `scripts/install-hooks` to enforce all styles.
- Order functions within a class in the following order:

# Dynamic Shape-Checking / Type-Checking (Typorch)
I'm interested in shape-checking for tensors. It doesnt need to be static type checking,
having fancy asserts would be good enough.

> (B, C, H, W)

> (B, 1, H, W)

> (B, H, W)

If you run a program with the shape-checker, it automatically inserts assert statements that the left side of the variable assignment must have that shape. Letters are tracked throughout (e.g. a new letter introduces a new variable), and a number asserts that that dimension must match exactly.

Tuple shapes maybe, to distinguish a shape comment from a regular comment.

Using this mode, the code is compiled uniquely and increases runtime.

Once you are confident with your shapes, you can simply run your program normally.
