My design studio of AI/ML/CS concepts.

Separated into two sections:
- Algorithms + Data Structures
- AI/ML

## Key Tenets
- Must work functionally
    - Unit tested, applicable
- Must be easy to read
    - Type-checkable, linted, and formatted code
    - Educational, designed for a CS students
    - Sacrifice efficiency and concision for readability

# Design Decisions
Three packages are exposed to the user - algorithms, ml, and structures.
Imports are done quickly and painlessly. We avoid circular imports by importing algorithms needed to create data structures inline.

# Dynamic Shape-Checking / Type-Checking (Typorch)
I'm interested in shape-checking for tensors. It doesnt need to be static type checking,
having fancy asserts would be good enough.

> (B, C, H, W)

> (B, 1, H, W)

> (B, H, W)

If you run a program with the shape-checker, it automatically inserts assert statements that the left side of the variable assignment must have that shape. Letters are tracked throughout (e.g. a new letter introduces a new variable), and a number asserts that that dimension must match exactly.

Tuple shapes maybe, to distinguish a shape comment from a regular comment.

Using this mode, the code is compiled uniquely and increases runtime.

Once you are confident with your shapes, you can simply run your program normally.
