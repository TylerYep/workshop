    The gamma distribution is a two-parameter family of continuous probability
    distributions. The exponential distribution, Erlang distribution, and
    chi-squared distribution are special cases of the gamma distribution.

    The parameterization with k and θ appears to be more common in econometrics
    and certain other applied fields, where for example the gamma distribution
    is frequently used to model waiting times.

    The parameterization with α and β is more common in Bayesian statistics,
    where the gamma distribution is used as a conjugate prior distribution for
    various types of inverse scale (rate) parameters, such as the λ (rate) of
    an exponential distribution or of a Poisson distribution
