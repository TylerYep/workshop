    The beta distribution is a family of continuous probability distributions
    defined on the interval [0, 1] parameterized by two positive shape
    parameters, denoted by α and β, that appear as exponents of the random
    variable and control the shape of the distribution.
    The generalization to multiple variables is called a Dirichlet distribution.

    The beta distribution is a suitable model for the random behavior of
    percentages and proportions.
