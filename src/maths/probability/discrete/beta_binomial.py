    """
    The beta-binomial distribution is a family of discrete probability
    distributions on a finite support of non-negative integers arising when the
    probability of success in each of a fixed or known number of Bernoulli
    trials is either unknown or random.
    The beta-binomial distribution is the binomial distribution in which the
    probability of success at each of n trials is not fixed but randomly drawn
    from a beta distribution.
    It reduces to the Bernoulli distribution as a special case when n = 1.
    For α = β = 1, it is the discrete uniform distribution from 0 to n.
    It also approximates the binomial distribution arbitrarily well for large α
    and β.
    Similarly, it contains the negative binomial distribution in the limit with
    large β and n.
    The beta-binomial is a one-dimensional version of the Dirichlet-multinomial
    distribution as the binomial and beta distributions are univariate versions
    of the multinomial and Dirichlet distributions respectively.
