# Future Plans
- Missing 1st layer of the model (0th layer).
- Printing model, named parameters, modules, children, parameters are all completely different to what I output. Figure out some way to combine all of these.
- I search for "weight" layers but am missing "bias" layers. Calculations are probably off by some small amount.
